As a Software Engineer, I have more than 3.5 years of experience in designing, building software on the web and mobile platforms. With the enthusiasm of youth, I am confident I can contribute my abilities to the development of the company, glad to share my knowledge with everyone, I think ``Learning to share, sharing to learn". Innovative, flexible in making good solutions to solve complex problems, ready to learn new technologies if needed. Super nerd who loves Vim, Linux and OS X and enjoys to learn JavaScript's frameworks (specializes in ReactJS).
